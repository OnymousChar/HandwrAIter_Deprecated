This package contains rec_line program, which is a part
of NHocr - the Japanese OCR, for SUSE Linux i686.

rec_line reads PBM/PGM/PPM image file(s), recognizes the text
line image for each file, and produces text data in EUC-JP.
Each file should contain only ONE horizontal text line image
without any surrounding dirt.

Running rec_line without any argument will show the usage.


Installation:

1. Copy PLM.dic into /opt/nhocr/lib

2. Copy rec_line into /opt/nhocr/bin or wherever you like.

If the location of PLM.dic is different, the environment
variable NHOCR_LIBDIR must be set to point to the library
directory.
